# WoW-Shuffler

This simple app enables players of the War of Whispers board game to shuffle starting positions on the loyalty track with two extra conditons - the devout position must be unique for each player or both devout and opposed positions must be unique.

The app comes in two versions - with or without images representing the empires, i.e. factions in the game. One can add (for example, buy the board game and take photos of) these photos on their own and keep the paths to them in environmental variables (variable names should be equivalent to empires names in lowercase). Without these images, the app will just run in the no-images mode.

I do not wish to infringe upon the copyright of the authors and the publisher. This app was made without commercial intent and for individual player's use only, as a fan project.
